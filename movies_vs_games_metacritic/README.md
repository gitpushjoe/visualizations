I webscraped this Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_video_games for a list of live-action and animated movies based on video games ```wikipedia_web_scrape.py```. I wrote a script to extract the name of the game series from the name of the movies ```enter_series_name.py``` and then scraped the rating of the highest-rated game in the series from Metacritic ```scrape_metacritic_score.py```. After that, I just had to clean up some mistakes in the dataset, and then produced the final graph above.
